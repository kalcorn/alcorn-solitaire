# Alcorn Solitaire

A classic Solitaire card game built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Card flip animations and responsive design  
- Timer and new game button in the header  
- Accessibility features including keyboard navigation and ARIA roles  
- Save and load game state using localStorage  
- Animated win celebration and sound effects (planned)  
- Supports draw-1 stock pile mode  
- Mobile-friendly layout with horizontal scrolling  

## Configuration Management

### Dual AI Configuration Setup

This project uses two configuration files for different AI contexts:

- **`.cursorrules`**: Primary configuration for Cursor IDE
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Configuration for Claude CLI and other AI tools

Both files are kept in sync automatically. The key differences:

1. **`.cursorrules`** includes: `**CRITICAL: IGNORE CLAUDE.MD FILE - USE ONLY THIS .cursorrules FILE**`
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** includes: `**CRITICAL: IGNORE THIS FILE WHEN RUNNING IN CURSOR - USE .cursorrules INSTEAD**`

### Syncing Configuration Files

To keep both files in sync after making changes to `.cursorrules`:

```bash
npm run sync-configs
```

This script:
- Reads `.cursorrules` content
- Creates `CLAUDE.md` with appropriate ignore directive
- Preserves all configuration rules and protocols

### Usage Guidelines

- **In Cursor**: Only `.cursorrules` is used (CLAUDE.md is ignored)
- **In Claude CLI**: Only `CLAUDE.md` is used
- **Manual editing**: Always edit `.cursorrules`, then run `npm run sync-configs`
